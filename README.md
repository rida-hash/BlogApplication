<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Writing is the most important new soft-skill for the dynamic tech industry, and it is a muscle that needs exercise to get stronger. The motivation behind my application is to promote this quality amongst new techies when drafting their newest publications. It is a Full-Stack Application, created to provide a groundwork ahead of time, for people to pre-post and review their content before finally uploading to the real world.

Here's why you should start today:
* Learning whilst teaching others can improve your own learning experience
* You gain more clarity over your subjects
* You learn the art of writing, hence effective communication

It is a project still under development, I'm working towards improving the Design, adding user registrations, embedding JavaScript to support image uploading and management. Additionally, deploying it using the Heroku Platform. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks!
